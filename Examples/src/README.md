To compile the samples you need an SDCC installation and set the location in Makefile

There are snapshots available here: http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/snap.php

Download the latest SDCC snapshot and install it.

Then use make to compile the samples:
```
  make 
```

Compilation will create a build folder and you can find the compiled (*.ihx) files there.
